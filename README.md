# Conways Game Of life

A game with simple rules founded by **Jhon Horton Conway**. Altough a simple game it is discussed that has a possibilty to solve every existing problem.

# Description

It has namely four rules:

- Any live cell with **fewer than two live neighbours dies**, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with **two or three live neighbours lives** on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with **more than three live neighbours dies**, as if by overpopulation.
- Any **dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell**, as if by reproduction.

It is a simple yet a complex simulation representing life itself. Intruged by it's properties I tried a simple simulation.
